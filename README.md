## Description
> `docker` `vagrant` `dev env` `lab env` `virtualbox`
Every time I learn a technology, I must set up a corresponding development environment. Others are repeating my steps. So I want to record my steps to build the environment as much as possible. Latecomers can build the development environment with one click, which can save a lot of time and focus on learning new things. As above. It also serves as my code repository.

## Installation

```shell
cd /path/to/onedir
git clone https://github.com/ExFly/ComputSciLab.git
```
